## Overview

For this challenege I am to build out the NFT preview card component and get it to look as close as possible to the design as possible.

### The challenege

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass (Scss)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenege I was able to practice using Sass (variables, partials).

### Continued development

In future projects I will continue working on gaining getter understanding of Sass, Flexbox, Grid and React. I think I still need more practice using these tools.

### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me with understanding the basic concepts of variables and partials.
- [Kevin Powell YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYWf2m_yzBQ&t=914s) - Thought me how to use parcel to bundle and use Sass.
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) -  I was able to use the Parcel website to understand further how things work.
